Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.\n- Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.\n- Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.\n- You\u2019re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity \u2014 a piece of a business \u2014 to gain your financial freedom.\n- You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.\n\n# Selling on the Internet\n\n- Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people.\n- The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven\u2019t figured this out yet.\n- Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.\n- Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.\n- Don\u2019t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.\n- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.\n\n# Get Specific Knowledge, Accountability, and Leverage\n\n- Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you.\n- Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.\n- Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.\n- When specific knowledge is taught, it\u2019s through apprenticeships, not schools.\n- Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.\n- Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.\n- \u201cGive me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.\u201d \u2014 Archimedes\n- Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).\n\n# Capital and Labor\n\n- Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability, and show resulting good judgment.\n- Labor means people working for you. It\u2019s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don\u2019t waste your life chasing it.\n- Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.\n- Code and media are permissionless leverage. They\u2019re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.\n- An army of robots is freely available \u2014 it\u2019s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.\n- If you can\u2019t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.\n- Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.\n- Judgement requires experience, but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.\n- There is no skill called \u201cbusiness.\u201d Avoid business magazines and business classes.\n- Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.\n- > Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.\n- You should be too busy to \u201cdo coffee,\u201d while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.\n- Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.\n- Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.\n- Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.\n- There are no get rich quick schemes. That\u2019s just someone else getting rich off you.\n- Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.\n- When you\u2019re finally wealthy, you\u2019ll realize that it wasn\u2019t what you were seeking in the first place. But that\u2019s for another day.\n\n\n\n````css\n.list > li {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 40px;\n}\n```\n\n```bash\n$ vim ./~zshrc\n```\n\n```python\n- You should be too busy to \u201cdo coffee,\u201d while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.\n\n- Work as hard as you can.
