```my mind still spitting
when the drums keep hitting
I was in a dark space
but Dilla brought me back```
 
Thank J Dilla and for YouTube
for keeping me on track
Intact with reality
For being the remedy
 
cruising through life
without any license
living like a saint
dreaming in paint
 
go insane on a plane
eating my lo mein
not buying propane
need to try cocaine
 
I get kicks on my own
tricks are not shown
and my pockets are sown
Sylvester Stallone
 
what must be rhymed can't be grammar
flow like myanmar
kruger luger
stampede centipede
I am tired of not having a jobs
but I have decided to write
You cannot stay away from me jimi
I shall be the want that wake myself
I myself the ultimate salary
povidone to be preliminary
I am the canary
shame on you
for I am the thinner
meaner
side of dilla.

This sit midi 
the hello fund of all 
babies and post born 
adults withschizos

My mind sings like
it sizzles
past the aions
and pasificts
the turn of the centruies
the age of the misfits

my my is what projects on to the wrold
I am the rememdy a god fo the time

THe sound is all I sseee

The time is what I know
I am the sinner of the born ahters
the time is where so 
She is the vibe
of the time
I know where I ned to go
And she is right
