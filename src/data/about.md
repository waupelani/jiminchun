# Intro

my mind still spitting
when the drums keep hitting
I was in a dark space
but Dilla brought me back
 
Thank J Dilla and for YouTube
for keeping me on track
Intact with reality
For being the remedy
 
cruising through life
without any license
living like a saint
dreaming in paint
 
go insane on a plane
eating my lo mein
not buying propane
need to try cocaine
 
I get kicks on my own
tricks are not shown
and my pockets are sown
Sylvester Stallone
 
what must be rhymed can't be grammar
flow like myanmar
kruger luger
stampede centipede
I am tired of not having a jobs
but I have decided to write
You cannot stay away from me jimi
I shall be the want that wake myself
I myself the ultimate salary
povidone to be preliminary
I am the canary
shame on you
for I am the thinner
meaner
side of dilla.
 
But Dilla brought me back
 
I made my mind to
share my thoughts
say my feelings
cause of you dilla
 
First to look for when I die
So I cannot go to hell
 
Please wish me well
Only in the afterlife
I choose to lose
 
Dilla brought me back
intact with reality
 
kay nine outshine
my life tupac
 
say mine
 
words are rhythm
language is rhythm
then you follow what makes your mind dance
follow the trials of your mind dancing
 
Copernius was right
days are long
and our time is right
 
say shit just to rhythm
rhythm is money
always running out money
starry nights within
 
 
Aion and Lions
Lying in babylon
she makes the milk
sing and the iris weep
the trees
are shaven with beer
rivers are crowned
men are sworn
albeit ransom shall be known
 
kingdoms fall and go
queens and kings are still made
ever so hastingly
reprimand the mantles
tying is on right
things are not seen
until they are within
side to chains are what binds us down
there were no river
boundy by shallow deeds
 
must I not see
the keeper of the might
and the sheer tears
of the bears
and the warbringers
of the juxtapose
jeers and cheers
are crowned each year
for they may finally see
from eye to eye
the nosebleed connection
is all that they ever needed
 
to survive in the flamery seeds the archetypes of the
weed cannot be in the night of the soul
 
we weep and cry until ed is gone
the starry night is what I might see tonight
heanes and bars
hells and swimming pools
welcome the angels and the bartenders
 
to see the teachers in toil
 
kids in vein
cherished in blood
sanguine red grape awesome
bourbon cheese cakes are thrown at their face
when none is shown. Children are made
each step of the way from prolonged death to the aion time they will never be a time when the goddess is right might see the time is ripe and see
 
I am the wonder oer of the worlds
the seerer oft eh sees the time of the time is
eevee shown here
 
in the pages of the newspapers the eyes will see
the mouth will water down the syndicates
 
of the aesthetic syndromes
 
that we seek
oh however you shalle
 
the freedom of the press is from the union
that beauty is dead
oh I thy cried in to the air
 
with no other beauty to witness
that beauty has perished
in the minds of the will
 
the anguish mob and social chromium
and chromosomes of electrical power and pproews.
 
river runs down the southern border
the of alps and the mexican drug king fish is the sauron thf the tree and night thwere smedjasd fhejfdskjtwrijf
 
chrom and kings
 
cheese and might
grass and hoppers
the stars nights
starry nights and starts
clash each night
 
it's sad to see that you don't know my worth
for I have thought you were goddess
as for I have had the king's eyes
 
 
For it is you that falls beneath me
and how shameful as I am who I know to be the most humble
