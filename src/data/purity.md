```my mind still spitting
when the drums keep hitting
I was in a dark space
but Dilla brought me back```
 
Thank J Dilla and for YouTube
for keeping me on track
Intact with reality
For being the remedy
 
cruising through life
without any license
living like a saint
dreaming in paint
 
go insane on a plane
eating my lo mein
not buying propane
need to try cocaine
 
I get kicks on my own
tricks are not shown
and my pockets are sown
Sylvester Stallone
 
what must be rhymed can't be grammar
flow like myanmar
kruger luger
stampede centipede
I am tired of not having a jobs
but I have decided to write
You cannot stay away from me jimi
I shall be the want that wake myself
I myself the ultimate salary
povidone to be preliminary
I am the canary
shame on you
for I am the thinner
meaner
side of dilla.
```
